## Task Manager API

This project is a Task Manager API built using Node.js and Express.js. It provides endpoints to manage tasks stored in a MongoDB database. The API allows users to retrieve tasks and add new tasks to the database.

## Installation

To run this project locally, follow the instructions below:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies by running the following command:

shell```npm install```


3. Set up a MongoDB database and obtain the connection link.
4. Replace `'mongoDB link hier einf√ºgen :P'` in the `app.js` file with your MongoDB connection link.
5. Start the server by running the following command:

shell```node app.js```


6. The server will be running on port 3000. You can access the API at `http://localhost:3000`.

## API Endpoints

The tasks are stored in a collection named 'tasks'.

This project uses the following dependencies:

- express: For building the API.
- mongoose: For connecting to the MongoDB database and defining schemas.

These dependencies are listed in the `package.json` file.

Feel free to use this project as a starting point for your own Task Manager API or customize it further to meet your specific requirements. Enjoy building and managing your tasks using this API!
